# Librevent 

This project is build as part of [quickened interoperability](https://quickened.interoperability.tracking.exposed), which is a complex plan that include this software, in conjunction with [mobilizon](https://joinmobilizon.org). 

## Getting ready

    sh ./buildall.sh

### What's interoperability ? 

Interoperability (_from wikipedia_) is a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions. While the term was initially defined for information technology or systems engineering services to allow for information exchange, a broader definition takes into account social, political, and organizational factors that impact system to system performance. Hence interoperability involves the task of building coherent services for users when the individual components are technically different and managed by different organizations.

### Why matter ?

Facebook empire based on owning data and decide how to serve them. These "data" is provided by people. People coalize to rivindicate their decisional power. Fediverse replace facebook. Librevents copy events from Facebook and repost them on Fediverse. 

Critical mass is the reason why Facebook remain dominan despite none of their records justify this. Librevent claim is:

## By liberating events from Facebook to Fediverse we might help migration on federated platform.

And that's all we're testing here! If you want to get more grasp of the actual impact (May 2021) please check out [mobilize.berlin](https://mobilize.berlin).
